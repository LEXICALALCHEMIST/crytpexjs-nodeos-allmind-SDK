NAX STACK


The architecture
NODEOS (runtime / injector)

ALLMIND (orchestration / extensions / hub)

XENO (intent → imprint → exoprint logic core)

NAX = the system law.
Minimal. Deterministic. Non-negotiable.

NAXUS
The platform

Streamable app layer
App manifests
Extension marketplace
Hosted + local hybrid execution
NAXUS is what people use and build on.
Formerly VAPOR / NEXUS → NAXUS is the right convergence:
Sounds infrastructural
Neutral to AI hype
Scales from apps → agents → machines

NAXUS APPS
The units
Streamed skins
Pure functions
Reactor-resolved
XENO-aligned

Calculator
Notes
Agent Blackbox
(DataDragon-powered by default)

Cryptex JS
The developer interface
SDK for building NAXUS apps
Manifest helpers
XENO frame tooling
Extension authoring
Cryptex = how builders touch NAX without touching the core.
